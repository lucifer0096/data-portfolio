# NBA 2024/25 Player Impact & Awards Analysis

Analyse game-by-game NBA player box-score data to identify high-impact players, explore MVP and DPOY candidates, and understand how role and game result affect scoring and efficiency.

## Dataset

- **Scope:** Full 2024/25 regular-season player game logs.  
- **Size:** 16,512 game records, 562 unique players.  
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eduardopalmieri/nba-player-stats-season-2425  
- **Time period:** October 2024 – April 2025.  

**Original columns (15 key stats)**  
- `Player`, `Tm`, `Opp`, `Res` – Name, team, opponent, result.  
- `MP` – Minutes played.  
- `FG/FGA/FG%`, `3P/3PA/3P%`, `FT/FTA/FT%` – Shooting stats.  
- `TRB`, `AST`, `STL`, `BLK`, `TOV` – Rebounding, playmaking, defence, mistakes.  
- `PTS`, `GmSc` – Scoring and game-score summary.

**Engineered columns**  
- `PTS36` – Points per 36 minutes (`PTS / MP × 36`).  
- `EffSimple` – Simple impact metric: `PTS + TRB + AST + STL + BLK − (FGA − FG) − (FTA − FT) − TOV`.  
- `DefImpact` – Defensive impact: `STL + BLK + DRB − TOV`.  
- `RoleBand` – Role band (Starter / Key Rotation / Bench) based on average minutes played.

## Tools & skills

- Excel for data cleaning, engineered columns, and pivot tables.  
- Advanced formulas for custom efficiency and defensive metrics.  
- PivotTables and charts to compare players by role, game result, and award candidacy.

## Business questions

- Which players deliver the highest overall impact over the 2024/25 regular season?  
- How do MVP and DPOY candidates separate from the rest of the league on scoring, efficiency, and defence?  
- How does player role (Starter, Key Rotation, Bench) affect production and impact?  
- How does performance change in wins vs losses for key players and roles?

## Approach

1. **Data preparation**  
   - Imported full game-log data and restricted to the 2024/25 regular season.  
   - Standardised team and player fields and created role bands based on average minutes played.  

2. **Feature engineering**  
   - Built efficiency and defensive metrics (`PTS36`, `EffSimple`, `DefImpact`) to capture per-minute and all-around impact.  
   - Flagged potential award candidates based on games played and minutes thresholds.

3. **Analysis via pivots**  
   - `Pvt_PlayerEfficiency_Top10` to rank high-minute players by efficiency.  
   - `Pvt_Top10_WinLoss` to compare individual performance in wins vs losses.  
   - `Pvt_MVP_Candidates` to focus on heavy-minute players (GamesPlayed ≥ 40).  
   - `Pvt_RoleBand_Top5` to surface the top 5 players in each role band.

4. **Visualisation**  
   - Built charts to show MVP and DPOY profiles, win/loss splits, and role-based comparisons.

## Key insights

- High-minute, high-efficiency players clearly separate from league-average contributors on both `PTS36` and `EffSimple`.  
- Defensive specialists with strong `DefImpact` scores emerge as DPOY-style candidates even when scoring is modest.  
- Role-based analysis highlights that some bench and key-rotation players provide starter-level impact in limited minutes.  
- Win/loss splits reveal players whose production translates most directly into team success.

## How to use

- Open the Excel workbook in this folder (`NBA 2k24-25 Analysis Project.xlsb`).  
- Start with **Info_NBA** for the project overview, dataset summary, and navigation.  
- Use **NBA_Working** to review cleaned data and engineered columns.  
- Explore **Player_Summary** and **Pivots_NBA** to drill into player- and role-level pivots.  
- Use **Dashboard_NBA** to interact with the key charts (MVP Bubble Scatter, DPOY Radar, Win vs Loss Combo, Role-based bar charts).

## Future improvements

- Incorporate on/off and lineup-level impact metrics to complement box-score analysis.  
- Extend the dataset to include playoffs and multi-season trends.  
- Automate data refresh using an NBA stats API and Power Query.  
- Add a companion Power BI dashboard for richer interactivity and sharing.
